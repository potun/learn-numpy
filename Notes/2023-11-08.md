# Jupyter
**Jupyter** is an open-source project that provides an interactive computing environment. It supports various programming languages, but it's most commonly used with languages like Python, R, and Julia. The name "Jupyter" is a combination of three core programming languages it supports: **Ju**lia, **Pyt**hon, and **R**.

The main feature of Jupyter is the notebook, which is a web-based interactive document that can contain both code (executable) and rich-text elements (like formatted text, images, and more). This allows users to create and share documents that combine live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.

# Jupyter Notebook Overview

## Files
Jupyter Notebooks are saved with the file extension `.ipynb`. This extension stands for "Interactive Python Notebook."

## Header Bar
The top of the notebook displays the notebook name and basic options.

## Toolbar
Below the header, a toolbar provides icons for common actions like creating cells and running code.

## Notebook Cells
The main body consists of cells, which can be of two types:

- **Code Cells:**
  Executable code with output displayed below the cell.

- **Markdown Cells:**
  Formatted text using Markdown for headings, lists, links, images, etc.

## Cell Modes:
- **Edit Mode:**
  Allows editing cell content (code or text).
  
- **Command Mode:**
  Allows operations on cells (add, delete, move).

## Execution Order
Code cells have an execution order number indicating the run sequence.

## Kernel
The computing engine executing code. Options in the kernel menu include restart and interrupt.

## Output Area
Displays results below code cells, including text output, plots, or error messages.

## Saving and Exporting
Save using the toolbar or shortcuts. Export notebooks to HTML, PDF, slides, and other formats.
